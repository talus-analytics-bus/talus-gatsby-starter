# Theme from Figma

The `styles.scss` file in this directory is generated from the Figma design using the `CSSGen` plugin; it can either be `@imported` as `scss` or it can be accessed as a JS object using <ðŸ’…>.

_This `styles.scss` file should not be edited directly, so that it can be directly overwritten from Figmaâ€”overrides should be done in the code where the change is needed._

The `globalStyles.scss` should provide a logical mapping between the figma generated names and html semantic elements, where applicable (i.e. h1, h2, p, and so on).
